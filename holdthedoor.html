            <h3>About the game:</h3>
            <p>
            This boardgame is designed for two players: one in the defensive position, defending the castle; one in the offensive role, attacking the bastion and trying to overcome the gate.<br>
            <br>
            The game consists of a battlefield and battlefield motificators, the attacker's soldiers, attack cards, castle defense upgrades, counter-attack cards, weather cards, and a set of dice.<br>
            <br>
            Before the game begins, the defening player equippes the battlefield additional challenges for the attacker, by positioning the battlefield modificators (swamp to slow down troops, chasm to pose danger of falling). He may also purchase defensive upgrades for his castle using a limited amount of purchasing points. Likewise, the attacker may purchase different troops: he can choose any number of foot soldiers, heavily armed soldiers, and cavallery soldiers. Each class has individual stats, and can be purchased for varying amounts of points.<br>
            <br>
            Each turn consists of two phases and is played as follows:<br>
            <br>
            Phase 1: The top most of the weather cards (deck facing down) is turned around. The weather affects both the stats of the attacker's soldiers and those of the defender's counter-attacks. The attacker may then move any arrangement of single-class units onto the battlefield (eg. any number of units of foot soldiers in any configuration). Alternatively, he may move all of his troops already on the battlefield. The defender then either playes one the counter-attack cards in his hand against the attacker's troops in the field, or he may exchange one of the cards he's holding for the bext card on the downward-facing deck.<br>
            <br>
            Phase 2: In addition to deploying or moving troops, the attacker may also roll the dice to try and break through the gate for each of his soldiers standing on the last row of fields before the castle. Each soldier whose break-through attempt fails, is then subjected to an at-gate counter-attack by the defender. Should both the attackers and the defenders moves fail, then the standoff continues in the next turn.<br>
            <br>
            The game is over when either a) the attacker has managed to enter the castle with 7 of his soldiers, making him the winner, or b) the attacker has no more than 7 soldiers left, counting together those in the defender's castle, those on the battlefield, and those in reserve. In this case, the defender wins.

                <h3>My work for the game:</h3>
                <p>
                <i>Hold the Door</i> is based on a game design concept I came up with for a partner-project in a class. My work consisted of adapting my original idea to maximize balancing and flow of the game, setting the game mechanics and rules, designing the components of the game and creating some of the illustrations for the play cards. To complete the game, I also wrote a player manual and sewed a simple cotton sleeve with a tie, in which the game board, cards, and all other pieces can be stored.

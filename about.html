            I really hate this self-presenting stuff. Anyway - here it goes.<br>
            <br>
            My name is Anna. <br>
            I usually prefer for people to forego my last name. There really is no pint in them trying to pronounce it. Funny story, actually:<br>
            You see, my father is of Hungarian heritage. I say 'heritage' because he really isn't all that Hungarian himself. Or rather, he didn't use to be. He never even learned the language until my siblings and I were in our late teens.<br>
            Anyway, as a kid, he resented being 'different' from his Swiss school friends, and denied this difference by refusing to speak his parents' language. Thus, we never learned Hungarian either.<br>
            The unpleasent consequence of this is that whenever I speak to another, older Hungarian - and there are many where I grew up - the conversaton <i>inevitably</i> turns to my last name. When this happens, the old Hungarians love to promt me to say my own last name, and then greatly enjoy making fun of me for 'not saying it right'.<br>
            Well guess what. Hungarian sounds weird. The noises they make sound weird. It's hard. I don't speak it. But do I make fun of <i>you</i> for having lived in Switzerland for 50-something years, without learning proper German?<br>
            <br>
            <i>Ugh.</i><br>
            <br>
            Sorry for that little introductary rant. Anyway - that's the story of why you should just forget about my last name. Anna is fine.<br>
            <br>
            I'm a Games major at Northeastern. I've been on somehwat of an educational detour since I graduated Swiss Gymnasium in 2012: I studied Ancient Studies for three whole years. That hasn't left me with a useful degree, but a mass of random knowledge and something of a geeky preference for anything dead and dusty.<br>
            I also like animals. Yes, I would love a pony; why thank you!<br>
            Coffee is life. Please don't talk to me. I haven't had my coffee yet. <br>

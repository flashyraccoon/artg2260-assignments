            <span class="illumination">Y</span>ou've escaped the busy city onto the island of green that is Dorchester Heights. Turning around, you can see South Boston below; wathich typical coastal town activities, you see fishermen scurrying around their boats, moored in a small marina. Out in the bay, larger ships are sailing slowly across it, carrying merchants and their goods, passengers, and all manner of other things and people. Looking just a bit further, the city of Boston lies before you. And crowning the city, gleaming like a jewel in the sun, the New State House. Reaching higher into the sky than any of the numerous church steeples, it stands sentinel over the city and the bay. The building has persisted for a century; it has seen growth and destruction, battle and victory, has seen the land around it transform and the city flourish, and it has seen hardship. You wonder what things it may yet come to see.
